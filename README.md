## What is FoodFlow OS?

FoodFlow OS is an **AI-powered operating system** that unifies data from production, supply chain, quality control, and regulatory systems into a single, intelligent platform.

3. **Predictive Intelligence** - Forecasting, anomaly detection, and risk scoring
4. **Optimization Engine** - Production planning, inventory optimization, and routing
